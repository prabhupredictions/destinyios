This document outlines the journey of a user within the Destiny AI Astrology app, detailing the progression from a curious guest to a highly engaged "Plus" subscriber. It focuses on the usage limits (entitlements) and the experience at each stage from a user's perspective.

---

## Phase 1: The Curious Guest (Guest Tier)
**Persona:** First-time download, skeptical but curious, wants to "try before buying."

### Experience

*   **AI Questions:** 3 Total (Lifetime).
    *   *Scenario:* "What does my rising sign mean?", "Will I be rich?", "Is today lucky?" -> **Limit Reached.**
*   **Compatibility:** None.
    *   *Upsell:* "Sign in to unlock your first compatibility match."

## Phase 2: The Account Holder (Registered Tier)
**Persona:** Sees value, wants to save their birth chart, willing to provide email for safety and a bit more access.

### Experience
The user registers an account. Their chat history is preserved. They get a slightly expanded trial to test the relationship features.

### "Extended Trial" Limits
*   **AI Questions:** 10 Total (Lifetime).
    *   *Scenario:* Enough to have a meaningful conversation about one specific topic.
*   **Compatibility:** 1 Match Total (Lifetime).
    *   *Scenario:* Checking compatibility with one crush or partner.
*   **Profiles:** 2 Total.
    *   *Scenario:* Self + 1 Partner.

## Phase 3: The Seeker (Core Subscriber)
**Subscription:** $4.99/mo
**Persona:** Daily user seeking guidance. Wants to check horoscopes, ask daily questions, and check compatibility with a few people (dating, friends).

### "Daily Guidance" Entitlements
*   **Dual Limits:** Users have generous **Daily Quotas** for recurring use, backed by **Lifetime Fair Usage Caps** to prevent abuse.
    *   *Note:* Daily counters reset at midnight. Lifetime caps trigger a support review if hit.

| Feature | Daily Quota | Lifetime Cap | User Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Questions** | **100 / day** | 300 total | Enough for very deep, hour-long conversations every single day. |
| **Compatibility** | **25 / day** | 100 total | Can check compatibility with a new match every hour without worry. |
| **Profiles** | **5 / day** | 50 total | Can save "Self" + 4 others (e.g., Partner, Mom, Best Friend, Ex). |
| **Switches** | **5 / day** | 50 total | Can switch views between their saved profiles 5 times a day. |
| **Multi-Profile Match (Compare All)** | **1 / day** | 5 total | Can run one "Group Comparison" per day to see who fits best. |

### scenarios
*   **Morning Ritual:** Asks "What is the energy for today?" (1/100 used).
*   **Dating:** Adds a new match, checks compatibility (1/25 used).
*   **The Wall:** If they try to add a 6th profile or switch to a 6th unique person in one day, they are prompted to **Upgrade to Plus**.

## Phase 4: The Enthusiast (Plus Subscriber) ⭐️
**Subscription:** $7.99/mo
**Persona:** Power user. Astrology enthusiast. Tracking many relationships (family, friends, wider dating pool). Wants a "worry-free" experience with no friction.

### Experience
The "Plus" user experience is defined by **freedom**. The friction of managing profiles is removed. They can save everyone they know and switch charts instantly.

### "Worry-Free" Entitlements

| Feature | Daily Quota | Lifetime Cap | User Experience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Questions** | **100 / day** | 600 total | **2x the lifetime limit** of Core. Truly extensive usage. |
| **Compatibility** | **50 / day** | 200 total | **2x the daily & lifetime limit**. Check matches effortlessly. |
| **Profiles** | **UNLIMITED** | **UNLIMITED** | **Key Differentiator.** Save 10, 20, or 50 people. Never delete a profile. |
| **Switches** | **UNLIMITED** | **UNLIMITED** | **Key Differentiator.** Switch between charts 100 times a day if you want. |
| **Multi-Profile Match (Compare All)** | **10 / day** | 100 total | Compare diverse groups of friends/family daily. |

### Scenarios
*   **The Networker:** Adds 7 friends at a party to check everyone's charts. *Core users would hit a limit; Plus users don't seeking.*
*   **Deep Dive:** Spends hours asking questions about complex transits. The 600 lifetime cap ensures fair use, but the 100/day daily limit feels bottomless.
*   **Relationship Tracking:** Keeps ex-partners saved for reference without sacrificing slots for new dates.
